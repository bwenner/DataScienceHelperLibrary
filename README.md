# DataScienceHelperLibrary
A collection of functions regarding analysis of data frames, series, preparation of data, ...

What you need to use this library in python:
- Packages: pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk

Motivation:

I quickly get fed up by coding the same code again and again, if used libraries don't support functions needed.
So i decided to put those into my own library.

Files in this repro:

- DataScienceHelper.py - python file as described above

Interaction & License:

Feel free to use this library, there is no license. Feedback towards improvement are always welcome :)
